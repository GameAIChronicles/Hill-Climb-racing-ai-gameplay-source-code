In this repository I have provided the python code for hill climb racing if any want can download and modify accordingly 

To understand this code you have know about python and little about tensorflow and gymnasium most importantly reinforcement learning and machine learning.


I have used python to program this,

First is the ENV_Hill_climb in this the environment of the project is defined in a way of gymnasium module

second is the environment checker this file check the environment file is proper for the gymnasium and for training.

third is modeling file where it play the game and understand the game environment. and save to the path mentioned.

fourth is the model proceed in this the previous saved model is more Traied for a particular timelapse
